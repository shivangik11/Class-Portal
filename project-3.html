            <p>Learn a new tool (JS library, CSS library, TypeScript, some other build tool, etc.) to add to your personal web development toolkit. Document your process of learning the new tool along the way. Show off this new tool by either adding onto your project 1 (or any other existing project), or by creating a new website or web app. The overall project requirements are as follows:
            <br><br>
              Website/web app must be of project scale. This means something different to everyone, which is why there is a project proposal stage where we have a discussion about what project scale means to you. Bottom line is it needs to be something you put more effort into than any of the smaller assignments, including your class portal.
              The user experience must be significantly enhanced by the use of JavaScript.
              The topic/subject of the website can be anything you desire.

        <h2>  Milestone 1 </h2><br>
        <p>I want to use react to create an interactive website portfolio and make it as dynamic as I can. As a user experience (UX) designer, one of the JS libraries that is very much in demand is react, and I want to learn it and add it to my skill set so that I can take advantage of its popularity. My primary objective for this assignment is to study react. And I believe that developing something that is very much connected and will allow me to experience myself as well as making an interactive website portfolio will assist me in learning the principles of the website as well as having a basic concept of what it is.

          Creating a portfolio with the assistance of new skills will help me to use it as much as possible. This is something throughout which I can showcase my work and can have the use of this project at the same time. Portfolio is something that I can make in use as I am looking for full-time opportunities. Creating a portfolio with the assistance of new skills will help me.
          
          The look and feel of the website: I am considering putting my information on the website, such as what I do and what my goals and focus areas to work on are. I am not very sure about the look of the page, but this is something I am trying to put out there. I am still learning this software, and I am not sure how this is going to turn out. I'm not able to show how the interactive aspect is going to be with this, but I really want to explore animation with react and give it a feel for my portfolio. Here is a sketch of something that I want to follow up on.

        <h2> Milestone 2</h2><br>
        <p>Because I intend to develop the landing page of the portfolio with certain interactions and make it more user centric, I have begun working based on the react framework. I am having trouble getting a handle on the fundamentals of react, and with the assistance of a variety of learning tutorials and resources that are already available, I am working on developing a portfolio website that is aesthetically pleasing. 
          <br>Here are a handful of links that I'm referring to when I talk about learning and drafting and reacting:

        <h2>  Milestone 3 </h2><br>
        <p> With the assistance of a number of different tutorials, I was able to create an interactive website for my portfolio. In the end, I developed a web page for my portfolio that had parallax scrolling. The programming language that I was working on at the time was react. My education included animation, and I eventually came to the conclusion that I was capable of doing it. Due to the fact that this was the very first time I had ever developed anything using react, the experience served as a valuable learning opportunity for me. As a front end designer, it was essential for me to have a fundamental understanding of react.
