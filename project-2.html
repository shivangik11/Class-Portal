            <h1> Project 1: process Blog </h1><br>
            <p>Create a website or web app that is enhanced by your modern JavaScript toolkit that you have built up over the first few months of the semester. The overall project requirements are as follows:<br>
              <br>
              Website/web app must be of project scale. This means something different to everyone, which is why there is a project proposal stage where we have a discussion about what project scale means to you. Bottom line is it needs to be something you put more effort into than any of the smaller assignments, including your class portal.
              The user experience must be significantly enhanced by the use of JavaScript.
              The topic/subject of the website can be anything you desire.

        <h2> Ideation: Milestone 1 </h2><br>
        <p>Creating a website on your own is a demanding task. So many things to consider, from color combinations to font types, styling fonts, font sizes, image placements, and so on. So here I am, pondering a solution. Creating a webpage that will allow you to customize your webpage immediately and be as creative and interactive as possible. Lookbook is a type of webpage where you can experiment with different colors, fonts, and placements to create your own designer webpage before coding it.

          Initially, I struggled with designing and creating web pages at the same time. This page would be really useful for anyone who want to explore it while also coding it.
          
          I want to make the website more interactive so that users may experiment with the various possibilities presented by the page.
          
          </p>

      <div class="interactive features">
        <h2> Milestone 2</h2><br>
        <p>for milestone 2  I am now working on the functioning prototype of the lookbook. In addition to this, I have been working on the xd program, which assists me in comprehending the design viewpoint of the page and provides me with a prior knowledge of the measurements of the page that are pixel perfect. In response to the feedback that was provided, I have added a feature that enables the user to view predefined examples on the page that was provided. I have put up a lookbook that is two pages long. In the first page, users will be able to experiment with the page using the options that have been provided in order to produce an engaging landing page. In the second page, users will be able to refer to examples that have been provided, and with the assistance of those examples, they will create a landing page.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="font">
        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <p> I intended for the look book to be as user-friendly and interactive as possible. Here, I want to give users the opportunity to experiment with various parameters, including colors, text, font style, and font type. Initially, I believed that I could accomplish this by utilizing the numerous online tutorials and resources available. As a novice and novice coder, however, I struggled greatly. Attempting to add a large number of additional parameters to my learning library will give me an advantage to learn more and explore the java script field. 

          Initially, I had a timeline of completing it within two to three weeks, but due to difficulties with javascript, I was unable to do so. As a result, I needed an additional week to complete it, and I believe I am nearly finished. 
          
          This project was a significant learning experience for me; it helped me gain a scientific understanding of the project as well as a fundamental understanding of js. This project taught me a great deal, including window sessions, get element by ID in depth, how to call html functions in java script, and how to alter the style using javascript code.</p>
