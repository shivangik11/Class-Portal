            For your final project of the semester, you are to create a single page application Links to an external site. (SPA) using React.js, or any front-end web development framework of your team's choosing. This project is a team project, and every team member must contribute code for any team member to earn credit. Teams can be 2-3 members. Similarly to the first project of the semester, there is no specific topic to this project, and it is up to you and your team to decide if you want to create something practical, something that sends a message, something totally fun and creative, all of the above, or really just anything else you can think of! The main goal of the project is to demonstrate that you have the ability to code on a team, and that you understand the basics of creating an SPA using a front-end wed development framework.

            The requirements in bullet-point form, rather than paragraph form are as follows:
            
            Create a single page application (SPA) using React.js, or any front-end web development framework
            The SPA must be of "project scale"

          Project Topic: Single-page web application for course registration using React.js.<br><br>
          
          The project's goal is to develop a practical/real-world application. As students, we all use or have used the online course registration tool. I believe the time has come to construct one. In this application, students can choose from a list of available courses, browse through each course, view detailed information, add the course to their cart, and complete the registration process. The app will have multiple pages such as a course cart page, a registered courses page, and so on. We can demonstrate what we've learned about React.js and how to use concepts like creating react components and using react router to create single-page web apps with this project.<br><br>
          
          Features<br>
          
          1. Browse course list<br>
          2. Course detail page<br>
          3. Add course to cart <br>
          4. Check cart items<br>
          5. Complete course registration<br>

        <h2> Milestone 2</h2><br>
        <p>We wanted to create a project UI prototype for this milestone. So we could figure out how to divide the app into component structures and plan for the MVP. We started with low-fidelity wireframes and then progressed to a high-fidelity prototype.
          <br>We will be using React router package to implement the Single page application (SPA) using React. The app is split in to 4 different pages.<br><br>

          1. Home<br>
      
          2. Course Detail<br>
          3. Cart<br>
          4. My Courses<br><br>

          Breaking The UI Into components<br><br>
          
          Splitting the UI into to components so that each component adheres to single responsibility principle. Each component is responsible for one particular task alone.
          
          We have split the UI into components.<br><br>
          
          1. Navigation header Component<br>
          2. Course list Component<br>
          3. Search Component<br>
          4. Cart component<br>
          5. Course Detail Component<br>
          6. The cart/my course item component<br>
          7. Error message component (when the user tries to add a course that is already in cart/registered courses and when the time schedule clashes) To make the UI interactive we need to provide React with state. The change in state tell react that something has changed and re-render the component to trigger changes.
          To maintain the Application wise state we decided to use the useContext() react hook.

        <p> MVP (Minimum Viable Product) For the MVP, we’d like to create all of the pages with their respective components and styles, as well as apply the routing. As a stretch goal, we’d like to have the entire application completed and working properly.
